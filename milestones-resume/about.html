    <p class="about-paragraph">This page was created as a reference and resume to my future employers to showcase the skills that I have developed, <br>
      and the things that I am currently studying or will study. I am most interested in GIS (Geographic Information Systems), <br>
      educational, and language technologies, but I am willing to learn other fields of study within the software development <br>
      world. I currently have practice with python, Javascript, html, and CSS generally, and am studying other programming <br>
      languages. If you are interested in communicating with me, please send me a message on my LinkedIn page. <br> 
      Additionally, I have a resume that you can view on LinkedIn as well. This showcases other skills that I have <br>
      like customer service, and Spanish fluency. <br></p>
