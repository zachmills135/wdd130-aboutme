    <p> I am currently enrolled with BYU-I persuing a Batchelor's of science in Software
    Engineering, with a minor in Spanish. I also plan to study GIS (Geographic Information Systems).
    I have always enjoyed maps and geography. I love the globe and
    hope to be able to find a career in this field someday.
    So far I have been able to develop general work experience and ethic in a variety
    of places ranging from estate yards, to kitchens, to offices. I have developed
    skills to meet customer needs and manage stressful situations in call centers
    I have also learned diciplines of cooking, and landscaping that have helped me
    learn to work hard and with a persistent nature.</p> <br>
